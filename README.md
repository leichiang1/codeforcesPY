# codeforcesPY

This repository contains my solutions to problems using the python programming language. These solutions are meant for me to strengthen my python skills by being competitive. This will allow me to become better at mathematics, data structures, and algorithms.

My dream goal is to be a student at UT Austin Computer Science. I will give my all to make sure that happens.
